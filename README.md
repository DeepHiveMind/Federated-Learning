## What is Federated Learning?

The field of machine learning is constantly evolving, sometimes slowly, and at other times we experience the tech equivalent of the Cambrian Explosion with rapid advance that makes a good many data scientists experience a serious case of imposter syndrome. Take the case of a new iteration of machine learning called “federated learning” that was first introduced by Google AI in 2017 in a blog post “Federated Learning: Collaborative Machine Learning without Centralized Training Data” along with a now seminal research paper that set the stage for federated learning with a deep discussion of a new approach called federated optimization “Federated Optimization: Distributed Machine Learning for On-Device Intelligence” (Oct. 2016). In just a few years, this new methodology has taken significant strides forward.

In this page we’ll explore federated learning in terms of its beginnings, benefits, challenges, as well as some recent advances.
